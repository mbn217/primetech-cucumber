tags = "@wip"
#Override tags from command line:
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke"    -- It works for cucumber version 5 and below

mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke"       -- It works for cucumber version 6 and above

mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke and @regression"       -- It works for cucumber version 6 and above


-------------------------------------------
#Suppose you want to run a single Feature File from the command line, then use the below syntax
mvn test -Dcucumber.features="src/test/resources/features/Bing_Search.feature"

#If we want to run a single Scenario from the command line and no tag is assigned to that scenario, this is how we specify:
mvn test -Dcucumber.features="src/test/resources/features/Bing_Search.feature:12"

#If we want to generate a different report, then we can use the following command
#and see the HTML report generate at the location mentioned:
mvn test -Dcucumber.plugin="html:target/xyz-html-report.html"


#If we want to pass more than one parameter, then we can use the following command:
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke and @regression" -Dcucumber.plugin="html:target/xyz-html-report.html"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
when you run mvn test without explicitly adding the Surefire Plugin in your pom.xml,
Maven still runs the tests by default using the Maven Surefire Plugin.
This is because the Surefire Plugin is included as part of Maven's default lifecycle, and it is implicitly used during the test phase.

So, unless you need custom configurations (e.g., running specific tests, setting timeouts, or modifying reports), you don't need to manually include the plugin in your pom.xml. Maven will automatically invoke it when you run mvn test. However, if you need to customize how your tests run, you'll need to explicitly define the plugin in your pom.xml with the required configuration.

To summarize:

Without adding Surefire plugin: Maven uses the default version and configuration of the Surefire Plugin.
When to add Surefire plugin: Add it when you need custom settings like test exclusions, custom reports, etc.
